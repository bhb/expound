#### Improving the display of "context" values

I've continued work on the problem of how to allow users to adapt the error messages for their specific use case. 

I drafted an [ADR](https://github.com/bhb/expound/blob/master/doc/arch/adr-003.md) (still a work in progress) and spent time spiking out some solutions.

This is a fairly tricky problem and I certainly have lots to learn about designing a "data API". If anyone has tips, ideas, or links to prior work, please leave a comment on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bhb/expound/issues/189) or start a discussion in the `#expound` channel on [Clojurians Slack](http://clojurians.net).
