# Project Update 2: 2019-12-16 - 2019-12-31

Over the past year or so, I've received a number of feature requests that fall into the following two categories:

* users want to embed Expound messages in a larger error message or insert extra information into the Expound message
* users want to modify how the invalid value is printed

Most of my time has been spent doing some design thinking on how I could support these features.

In addition, I've completed a few small tasks:

* fixed several boxed math warnings
* fixed a bug with using Expound in ClojureScript

I've released Expound 0.8.3 and 0.8.4 which includes these fixes.
