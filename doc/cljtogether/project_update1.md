# Project Update 1: 2019-12-01 - 2019-12-15

I've been focusing on working through the backlog of bugs. I fixed three bugs:

* Bug with printing failures for multi-specs.
* Bug with registering message for set-based specs
* Bug with duplicate custom messages in `alt` or `or` specs

These three bugs are the last known bugs in Expound (not including one bug that is blocked on a `clojure.spec` bug).

I've released Expound 0.8.2 which includes these fixes.
