# ADR 003: Easier editing of error messages

## Problem Statement

Besides a fixed set of [printer options](https://github.com/bhb/expound#printer-options), users can only manipulate error messages by parsing and manipulating the string returned by `expound-str`.

Expound does not consider the format of the error messages to be part of the API and so changes that break client string-parsing code is likely to break at some point.

Why might a user want to manipulate the error message?

* Minimizing [large vectors](https://github.com/bhb/expound/issues/108) or [maps](https://github.com/bhb/expound/issues/129) when printing out the invalid value
* [Adding additional information](https://github.com/bhb/expound/issues/148)

## Context

Currently Expound can only return a single string for the error message. If a user wants to add, omit, or change information, they must do so using the string.

It's not clear that users would use an solution that allowed for easier editing of error messages: they might instead just want more fixes or features that solve the problem automatically.

If Expound tries to do the right thing in all cases, it will get complext to maintain and to use since users will have to guess how/why it's showing or omitting certain information.

## Prior Art

### [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)

Hiccup is a data format for representing HTML

**Tradeoffs in the context of this problem:**

* \+ Optional second element (map) is a place to add classes and IDs, which add semantic meaning
* \- Not intended to cover aspects like indentation and whitespace, since HTML/CSS is responsible for that

### [Fipp](https://github.com/brandonbloom/fipp/blob/master/doc/primitives.md)â€¨
Fipp is a better pretty printer for Clojure and ClojureScript

**Tradeoffs in the context of this problem:**

* \+ Focused on pretty printing, so primitives reflect that
* \- No place to add meaning which would allow users to find content based on ID or class
* ? Potentially more general than this particular problem requires
* ? Fipp is very fast, but Expound doesn't require that much speed

## Possible solutions

### Include Fipp

Expound could depend on Fipp for pretty-printing. All functions that generate a string would return Fipp data structures.

**Tradeoffs**

* \+ Don't need to reimplement algorithm
* \+ Can rely on existing documentation for data primitives
* ? Does Fipp provide code to extract/manipulate the primitives? Do we want to provide this so Expound clients can manipulate data structure?
* \- Take on two new deps: Fipp and `org.clojure/core.rrb-vector`. 
  *  Fipp is well-maintained, but there are complex issues like [this](https://github.com/brandonbloom/fipp/issues/60)
* \- Doesn't provide way to add semantic information about elements beyond formatting
* \- Requires a wrapping layer if we don't want clients to be exposed to Fipp internals

### Write a custom data description

I could come up with my own custom data language to describe the errors.

* \- Need to write more code
* \+ Can make it custom to error messages
* \- Need to write more documentation for format
* \+ Creates a more stable API for changes (format is stable, although content of strings are not)
* \- Creates a more complex API (more functions)
* \- Requires more testing for backwards compatibility
* \+ Speeds up building internal features
* \+ Provides solution for advanced users that doesn't rely on string manipulation
   * Encourages libraries to use Expound as dependency
   * Provides temporary solution for advanced use cases (can still build configuration if I want, but not necessary for all cases)
   * May provide long-term fix for use cases I don't want to move into Expound

### Don't expose data description

I could make an internal data API that is not exposed to users.

**Tradeoffs**

* \+ No need to add new functions (which won't be used my most users anyway)
* \+ Still allows faster iteration on internal features
* \- If I want to solve the issues linked above, I'll need to either add complexity to the Expound rules OR add more configuration
   * Additional configuration adds potential for bugs as number of combinations grows
   * I'm not sure users use the configuration I expose now
* \+ No additional API to test for breaking changes
* \- String format becomes an API that users cannot rely on
* \- Does not encourage tools to use Expound internally
